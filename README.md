(Todo webapp with tasks handling)

[This app is part of a university exam]

This app is a webapp to organize stuff. basically it is a todo app.
I extend the common "todo-apps-do-todo-stuff" functionality by adding a task handling. You can add tasks to the todos. That allows you to split bigger work items (todos) into some smaller items (tasks).

Also, a focus mode is planned.
